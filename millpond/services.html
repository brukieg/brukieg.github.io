		<h2>What to expect</h2>
			<p>When you are looking for a veterinary care clinic you should be able to count on superior care and excellent service.  We at Mill Pond Animal Hospital in Pinckney MI have assembled an expert team of veterinary professionals to bring you the best possible healthcare for your pet.  We have a state of the art veterinary facility which is clean, comfortable, and efficient.  Call (734) 878-4302 to schedule an appointment and we will find a time that is convenient for you.</p>

			<p>Once a year, you should bring your pet in for a check-up.  This will include a full physical exam, and may include teeth and gum cleaning if needed.  Dr. John Diehr will check the health of your pet from head to tail, and you will be very happy you came to Mill Pond Animal Hospital for service.</p>

			<p>Bring in any medical history you have of your pet when you come to our vet clinic.  It's best to keep a journal of your pet's health throughout his or her life, including behavioral shifts.  If you have something like this, share it with our team.  If not, let us know everything that you think will be important.  Dr. Diehr can still work with whatever information you have.</p>
