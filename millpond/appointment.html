			<h2>Appointments</h2>
				<p> Our receptionists and team will attempt to accommodate all requests to the best of our ability and efficiently make appointments for you and your pet. . Emergencies are accepted anytime our clinic is open. If you feel you have an emergency with your pet, please call us or come to the hospital immediately. If possible it is best to call before coming in so that a staff member can advise you on your particular emergency.  Please remember that emergencies take precedence over routine visits.  We apologize for the possible inconvenience, but would do the same for your pet.</p>

			<h2>Emergency Care</h2>	
				<p>We have a veterinarian and personnel on duty 6 days a week who are trained and equipped to handle any urgent care your pet has. Usually an emergency team consists of at least one veterinarian and several technicians working together to save a pet's life. Emergencies can be things such a snail bait poisoning, hit by car, and chocolate ingestion. If you ever feel that your pet needs emergency treatment do not hesitate to call or come in immediately. </p>

				<p>We are also available for urgent care when the condition is not life-threatening, but you feel your pet needs to be seen before you are able to get an appointment. Our veterinarians will work to "squeeze" you in between scheduled appointments. When you arrive, our receptionists will be able to give you an estimate on how long you may have to wait in order to be seen.</p>
